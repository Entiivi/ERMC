# Common image patterns (adjust paths as needed):
# If you want to ignore all .png and .jpg in a particular folder, you can do:
assets/images/*.png
assets/images/*.jpg

# Or ignore all images globally (be careful: this ignores images anywhere in repo)
*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg
*.gif

# Build output, logs, etc.
dist/
build/
*.log
